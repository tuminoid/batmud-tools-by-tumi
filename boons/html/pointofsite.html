The boons calculator is a flexible tool for calculating any taskpoint or boon
related issues. Based on your input, it can base its calculations on money you
wish to donate, taskpoints or boons to be gained etc. It also has an option
to calculate half boons after certain full boon, which usually is BAD, but may
be useful in some combos. It even tries to use the remaining taskpoints to
smaller boons until nothing can be get anymore. It even shows how many taskpoints
are left after the boons!
