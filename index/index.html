<h2>Welcome to support.bat.org</h2>

    <p>
    Welcome to support.bat.org, the number one information &amp; tools site for
    the best, the oldest and one of the most popular MUDs in the world;
    <a href="http://www.bat.org/">BatMUD!</a>
    The site grew so popular that the very admins of the Bat offered to host it!
    </p>

	<p>
	This site is the fruit of the new co-operation with
    the administration of BatMUD. Combined with the tools I've created over the years
    and a little bits and pieces of data from the very depths of BatMUD itself, this
    site is supposed to be the number one support site for the players of our lovely
    game.
	</p>

    <p>
    It will take time for both the admins to create their side of the interface, and
    to include the data from there to the tools, so it will happen gradually and
    there won't be a sudden jump of quality seen. It will raise gradually, but steadily
    like it has always done. Hopefully the maximum quality with the combined forces
    will be much higher than ever before!
    </p>

    <p>
    Please note the disclaimer also, all complaints, praises and donations should be
    directed to me, as the game administration has nothing to do with the actual
    content of this site, they're all my handiwork.
    </p>

    <p>
    With those words I bid you welcome and hope you enjoy your stay. Please involve
    yourself tighter into the BatMUD community by creating an account to the
    <a href="/forum/">Discussion Boards</a>, and introduce yourself. Remember the old
    MMORPG motto: "It is not who you are or what you have, it is who you know!"
    </p>

	The site layout was renewed at 17th Aug 2006, and also visitorcounters were
	reseted. The highest load count was on
	<a href="/reincsim/">Reinc Simulator</a>, with 1.6M since Feb 2004. Not far behind,
	around 800k-1m loads were the
	<a href="/batmap/">Batmap-in-colour</a> and <a href="/forum/">Discussion boards</a>.
	Hope you enjoy the site.
