		<h3>Sales Search</h3>
		<p>A simpler tool called <a href="/sales/">Batmud Sales Search Engine</a>
		(BSSE) is a real new one (opened 1st Feb 2006),
		enabling you to search for items sold on sales channel. The search
		is based on my personal logs, so they are far from complete logs,
		but as I try idle more online to capture more of sales channel, they'll
		cover most of if. Enjoy!</p>
