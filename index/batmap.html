		<h3>Batmap-in-colour</h3>
		<p>Some of the tools are previously known to you, and will undoubtedly
		remain very popular, like the
		<a href="/batmap/"> Batmap-in-colour project</a>.
		News: 24th Jan 2006: The batmap was recoded and moved to the main site,
		from hut.fi servers.
		</p>

		<p><b>Update on Sep'05:</b> In future, the Batmap-in-colour will be customizable,
		auto-updated, and one can add their own places and tags on map. This however
		requires the database support I've been working on for a while, for the
		whole site.</p>
