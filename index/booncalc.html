		<h3>Boon/Donates Calculator</h3>
		<p><a href="/boons/">Boons calculator</a> provides you with an easy
		to use calculator for boons, answering questions like
		<span class="boons-question">'How many taskpoints you need for 2 full boons?'</span>,
		<span class="boons-question">'If I get daddy to donate 1k for me, how much suffeli do I get?'</span>
		and <span class="boons-question">'Damn, it seems those 11 full booners have donated... w000t! Nearly 3k euros!'</span>.
		The tool itself is kinda do-it-once-forget -kinda thingie, but I found it
		kinda entertaining to calculate possible suffeli combinations I might get :)</p>

		<p><b>Update on Sep'05:</b>Boon calculator has unfortunately been stuck in a
		kinda sucky state, my apologies on that. There is many boon calcs on the market,
		that are better than this, but once I have time, I'll update this too
		to be something more usable.</p>
