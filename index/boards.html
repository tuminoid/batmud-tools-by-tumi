		<h3>BatMUD Tools Forum</h3>
		<p>BatMUD Tools Forum, aka. <a href="/forum/">BatMUD Forums - support.bat.org!</a>
		is now open. Bustling with activity not seen on any other bat focused
		discussion board, the forums have settled their place as good place
		to spend time while regening, center of information and discussion
		about latest changes. Remember to register! Registered people have
		many advantages over non-regged people!</p>

		<p><b>Update on Sep'05:</b>The Forums have proved to be success as well,
		currently there is more than 300 members, and over 7000 posts. Of course
		the subject of BatMUD is limited, given that it has many many secrets people
		wish to keep that way, that is holding back the disucussions. Its great
		action anyways, and is great regen fodder at least! :)</p>
