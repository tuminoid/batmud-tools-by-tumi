		<h3>Top Expmakers &amp; Expgraph</h3>
		<p>The <a href="/expplaque/">
		Top&nbsp;Expmakers&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;ExpGraph</a> is moved under this new
		concept, service remaining the same. The looks are new, but
		finally, after all this time, I tried the old version (5.0) with my IE, and it
		was crappy :P Sorry people for putting you to use that, but hey, not my
		fault you use IE :)</p>

		<p><b>Update on Sep'05:</b>The Top Expmakers of the week, month and year are
		posted in general newsground in-game. If you want to look back the records in-game,
		try	this search: 'news search general twomi'. It gives you pretty comprehensible
		list of expmakers posts ever made.</p>
