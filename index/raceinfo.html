		<h3>Raceinfo</h3>
		<p><a href="/raceinfo/">Raceinfo</a> is new at my site too, concept
		is familiar from the other sites, except mine is comprehensive, listing
		all possible variables races have in a single table.</p>

		<p><b>Update on Sep'05:</b>Raceinfo has gathered the information pretty nicely,
		and is quite accurate and trustworthy. It ought to be, since also ReincSim is
		using the very same data directly, thus any changes in Raceinfo reflect on
		ReincSim too. Keep me updated folks!</p>
