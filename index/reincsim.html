		<h3>Reinc Simulator</h3>
		<p>I believe the most interesting new tool is the <a
		href="/reincsim/">Reinc Simulator</a>, which is able
		to calculate your exp needs, stats-to-be etc etc. The current version is
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">by no means final!</span> It is
		gathered from various sources, some less and some more reliable and some
		things are just plain guessed to make an estimate.</p>

		<p><b>Update on Sep'05:</b> The reincsim has proved to be THE most popular
		service of all. It is indeed turned out after finetuning to be in 95% cases
		95% accurate. Only certain minmaxing issues and very special combinations
		bug expwise. Statwise it is even more accurate, most of my own reinc land into
		1-2 off range max. Sp/hpmax issues are in "worst" situation right now, in
		many combinations you might still get 50hp or 100sp flaws, though thats still
		only 5% :)</p>

		<p><b>Update on Sep'06:</b> The reincsim now saves your reincs in easy dropdown
			menu, if you have registered and are logged on! No more fiddling with
			the bookmarks, or trouble having the same reincs around at home and work,
			or at school. They're always saved in the drop down menu for your
			convenience!
