batmud-tools
============

BatMUD Tools by Tumi - a code archive of old work

What is included
================

All the work done by me 2002-2007, for anyone interested. Some, maybe most of the code, has been deprecated already, use with care. The code with modifications should run pretty much as-is, though if it doesn't, its your job to figure out why the hell it won't :)
License

Note that the source is licensed under GPL v2, so you MUST share your source code as well. Sorry about that, but there is no free meal.

Technicalities
==============

On the technical side, the site runs on Apache + Perl 5.6.1+, using only flat files. Code is crappy, with lots of wtfs, I just never did have the time to do them better, sorry about that. The code is also probably poorly documented in most cases.

Whats missing
==============
Yabb2 forum

Forum software, including messages posted, member accounts, for one. The site uses the Yabb2 database to log-in users, so the site is unusable out-of-the-box if you don't have Yabb2 database around (even empty will do though).
Forum+ secret society data

Code for forum+ secret society is there, but the data won't.
