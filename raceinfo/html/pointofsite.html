Even the web has couple quite nice race information sites, like
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/ordos_batmud/races_short.html">Ordos's</a>
or <a href="http://www.megami.com/bat_race_atzsort.php">Presence's</a>
I got tired of not finding all the information at one place. Since the
renewal of the <a href="http://www.bat.org/">Bat.org</a> the situation
has been little better, since the racial information there is good; though
races are scattered to their own pages and browsing them efficiently for
comparison is difficult. This table should have all information about all
races in a single table, all at once. It is WIDE, but prints nice, after
scaling it down some. Enjoy!
