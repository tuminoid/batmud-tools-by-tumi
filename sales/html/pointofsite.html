The Batmud Sales Search Engine (aka BSSE) was created after
<a href="http://www.bat.org/help/finger.php?str=kimvais">Kimvais</a> wizzed and his
<a href="http://eq.77.fi/">B.A.D.A.S.S.</a>-engine was finally shutdown, after
being broken for several months. The sales channel logs are not complete, but
it should give some hints who might be selling eq you are interested in. Updates
to the DB are made twice a week, so its not real-time. Enjoy!
