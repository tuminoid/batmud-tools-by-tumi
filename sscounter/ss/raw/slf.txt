Description:

Skeleton Liberation Front is an ancient and aggressive organization. Its main
purpose is to liberate all the skeletons from their fleshy, enslaving masters.
A skeleton in itself is the most beatiful thing in a world - a combination of
strength and protection. Every white, amazingly shaped bone can be joined into
another, forming a deadly entity. But the respect of skeletons is shamefully
low. So SLF is tirelessy continuing its mission - to recognize the cry for
help. And there are many skeletons out there, ready to join the group...
