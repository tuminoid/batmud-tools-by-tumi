Ever since the Thanaxos dropped his Top Expmakers list sometime around 1999,
I had been missing them. I noticed that calculating those lists weren't so
difficult as I had thought, so I created my own scrpit for those near Xmas 2002.
The Top Expmakers was reborn! Later, inspided by Gurb's graph, after he
had suicided, I thought I could try to make one of those too, to fill in the
gap. I really suck at graphics, but using the GD library made it easier.
Early 2003, the Expgraph was reborn! Scalable, multiple sizes, adapting etc
featured graph is neat! Enjoy!
