   Description:
   There comes a time in every young dwarves life when he is sent to
   dwell away
   from his home clan to the community of the Crafters of Rock. Here the
   young
   striplings learn the ancient ways of the stone and steel, just like
   their
   fathers when they were young. The young dwarves work hard as
   apprentices in
   the forges and mineshafts, guided and commanded by their elders before
   they
   are accepted as full-grown members of their clans and communities.
