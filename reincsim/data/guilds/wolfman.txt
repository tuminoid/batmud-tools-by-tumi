                        The Wolfbane Elite Commando

   Command: wolfbane
   Creator: [22]Malitrius
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   The Wolfbane is a special force that is made of Wolfmen, a breed apart
   and a
   cut above the rest. Unquestionably the finest unconventional warfare
   experts
   of the Realm. Used to operate in remote areas and under spartan
   conditions.
   Their survival skills make them excellent scouts and guerilla
   soldiers.
