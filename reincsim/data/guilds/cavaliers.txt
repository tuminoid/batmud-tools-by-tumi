                         The Division of Cavaliers

   Command: cavalier
   Creators: [22]Shinarae, [23]Elwood
   Maximum level: 15
   Description:
   Since the beginning of warfare, the strongest and most skilled of
   warriors
   have joined the cavalry. While riding a horse or other mount, these
   fighters
   can utilize larger weapons, heavier armour, and yet move with greater
   speed. A
   trained cavalier is an expert in mounted combat, and while riding into
   battle,
   can strike with great force while suffering less damage than the
   infantry. A
   cavalier needs no code of conduct or religion, for they find guidance
   in the
   thundering hooves and flashing of steel, and little else.
