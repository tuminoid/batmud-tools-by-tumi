                      The Arctic Law, The Polar Police

   Command: artic_law
   Creator: [22]Malitrius
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   The arctic law, the polar police. The ultimate law on wide open spaces
   on the
   frozen tundra on the north. The worst battles are not always against
   murderous
   icebears or mean walruses but against the severe cold. You are teached
   the
   basic rules of survival in the north as polar police. But also some
   weapon
   skills and nifty magical tricks. Every penguin that can consider
   themself a
   member of the Arctic Law can be proud themself. The history of the
   Arctic Law
   and their heroic deeds is long and amazing. The lonely polar rangers,
   the law
   of the land where no sun shines and the ruthless king Bore rules.
