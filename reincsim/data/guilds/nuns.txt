                               Sisters of Las

   Command: nun
   Creator: [22]Zin
   Maximum level: 35
   Description:
   After the attack of daemon hordes to the old convent of the Sisterhood
   Abbess
   Abigail, the sole survivor of the assault, founded the convent of
   White Rose
   to an abandoned monastery, high at the mountains near Shadowkeep where
   the
   re-established Sisterhood of Las resides. Their studies combine weak
   healing
   spells, strong offensive spells against evil and undead entities and
   strong
   protective auras. The Guild is led by Synod, a holy council consisting
   of four
   elected nuns and the Guildleader as the head of the Synod. The Synod
   has full
   authority in the guild. Everyone wishing to join the sisterhood must
   have the
   blessing of one of the Synod members. Life in the Sisterhood is not
   always
   easy but it is said to be most rewarding.
