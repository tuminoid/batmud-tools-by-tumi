                     [fonter.php?str=Nomad+background]

                              Nomad background

   Command: nomad
   Creators: [22]Anipa, [23]Digga, [24]Argon, [25]Franco, [26]Dragoness
   Maximum level: 10
   Description:
   You have spent your entire life travelling the world with your parents
   and
   it shows in everything you do. The nomad way of life has become yours
   and
   you wouldn't have it any other way. Everything you know you have
   learned
   from your parents as your family wandered the surrounding areas. Your
   skills are somewhat limited to the knowledge of your parents and their
   ability to train you in what you need to know to survive in the nomad
   way
   of life. Your first 10 levels symbolize these days of teaching by your
   parents
   so you can better learn what guild(s) you want to join.
