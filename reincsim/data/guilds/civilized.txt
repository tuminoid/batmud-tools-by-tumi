                            Civilized background

   Command: civilized
   Creators: [22]Anipa, [23]Blowfish, [24]Shardik
   Maximum level: 10
   Description:
   The civilized background indicates that your parents are from a
   civilized
   culture. Unlike the barbaric Nomads, or the cloistered Religous folk,
   you
   have been raised with refinement. You understand commerce and trade,
   as
   has been passed on from your parents and their parents before them.
   You
   prefer a town to a wilderness, and aren't afraid to take what you
   need, if
   you choose. The skills and spells you learn during your first 10
   levels
   symbolize the things your parents have taught you: useful tools for
   survival and the tools of commerce and trade. You can't choose what
   you
   are taught, but those skills and spells will be yours throughout your
   adventurous life and the basis of all you learn in the future.
