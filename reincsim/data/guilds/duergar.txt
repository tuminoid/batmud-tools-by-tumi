                           The Profaners of Earth

   Command: profaners_of_earth
   Creator: [22]Shardik
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   The duergar fight the world from the first year of their life, they
   are born
   old and wise compared to most of the other weakling races. Even though
   they
   are solitary and pretty much hate their kin almost as much as they
   hate all
   the other races, their deceased elders still prefer duergar rule in
   the world
   and thus teach their descendants some skills when they are still
   young.
