                               The Club Club

   Command: club_club
   Creator: [22]Malitrius
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   The Club Club was originally created by a young group of cromagnon
   hunters
   that wanted to share their interest in clubs. Nowadays all young
   cromagnons
   join the club, because clubbing is cool. You still have to go through
   the
   mature rites of Ugh-Ugh Uragara before you can join the club though.
