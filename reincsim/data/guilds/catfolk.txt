                    The Followers of Silvan the Vagabond

   Command: vagabond
   Creator: [22]Malitrius
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   Nobody know for sure how or when the catfolk came to BatMUD. But
   according to
   their own lore they claim to be created by Silvan the vagabond many
   eons ago.
   Silvan has never confirmed or denied that claim. For he is what he is,
   the
   eternal vagabond. He don't give any obligations nor does he have any
   himself.
   Catfolk still worship him as their god. And they live by his codex. To
   live
   free without any obligations. But still their goal with their travells
   is to
   once meet Silvan and confirm their ancestry.
