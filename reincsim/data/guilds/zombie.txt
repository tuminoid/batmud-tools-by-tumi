                        The Children of the Zombies

   Command: zombie_children
   Creator: [22]Sirdar
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   In the past history, creatures from the other dimension have been
   visiting us
   as fathers and protectors. These creatures have seen the birth of a
   first
   human, and in the early years of evolution, the people called the
   Navigators
   gave them a name - Zombies, because these creatures were feared and
   avoided.
   But in time, their intentions became clear to the people - they were
   here to
   help us, on the contrary to the common beliefs. The zombies, after
   seeing the
   arrival of the gods, saw that the races were safe from the unseen
   enemy,
   retreated back to their dimension. Some zombies, however, decided not
   to
   return to their homeworld because they had grown too close to the
   fascinating
   world of humans. Finally, you have found home. Or have you?
