                         The Followers of Tarmalen

   Command: tarmalen
   Creator: [22]Dragoness
   Maximum level: 30
   Description:
   All followers of Tarmalen's teachings are healers. Even the youngest
   novice
   can ease the pain of the hurt and the priests can even raise the dead.
   During
   the War of the Gods Tarmalen and his wife Trilleon were captured and
   tortured
   by Mordian and his undead legions. He was rescued by Faerwon who
   killed
   Mordian and many of his most powerful undead servants. The grief of
   the Gods
   of Light was great when they learned that Trilleon, Tarmalen's
   beloved, the
   Goddess of Mercy, had perished under Mordian's torture. Tarmalen's
   grief and
   anger almost drove him to madness but finally something cleared his
   head and
   he continued to do his duty even though he is still stricken from
   grief. He
   does not like to heal evil people.
