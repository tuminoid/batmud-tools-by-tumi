                            The Elusive Brownies

   Command: brownie_order
   Creator: [22]Merri
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   Brownies are honest little folk that are distantly related to
   halflings, but
   more closely to elves. They are known as the helper race of faeries.
   Brownies
   occasionally help the lower class at night, only expecting a small
   reward of
   milk and cookies. They are dexterous, intelligent and nimble in
   nature. Their
   senses are keen, and they are superb in blending into their
   surroundings.
   Brownies rarely engage in combat, they only fight if they are cornered
   or
   threatened. Most will rely on magic when fighting. As brownies are
   very
   intelligent and agile, they use these characteristics as an advantage
   in
   combat. Brownies are honest to the core and malevolent brownies are
   really
   rarely seen.
