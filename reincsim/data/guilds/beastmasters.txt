                          The Herd of Beastmasters

   Command: beastmaster
   Creators: [22]Shinarae, [23]Elwood
   Maximum level: 15
   Description:
   Some would argue that what makes humans, elves, orcs, and other races
   more
   than mere animals is not fire, or steel, or even magic, but their
   ability to
   enslave animals and train them for service. The Beastmasters are
   throwbacks to
   those ancient times when hunting and capturing wild beasts was a
   necessity of
   life. They yoke the fiercest of beasts to harness their strength, and
   can even
   use their power in combat if need be.
