                           The Celestial Warriors

   Command: celestial_warrior
   Creator: [22]Sirdar
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   It's a good thing that the demons are preoccupied with a problem that
   keeps
   them off from the world. The Valars. It is a war of Valars against the
   demons.
   It's supposed to be a war in the other planes of existence, but
   everyone and
   everything seems involved. It's a war that has been going on sa long
   as
   mortals have lived on the world, and it's a war neither side has yet
   to win.
   Nobody even knows what are the exact goals of the war. Genocide's the
   best
   guess - the demons and the Valar will fight each other until there's
   none
   left. Why? Maybe some gods are playing and making the fight. Maybe the
   fight
   has ensued because both sides want to. Nobody knows for sure how the
   war
   started. The war is a grim blessing to the world, but too bad only the
   Valar
   race is interested in the welfare of mortals.
