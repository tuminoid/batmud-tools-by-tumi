                                The Outcasts

   Command: outcasts
   Creator: [22]Runeaxe
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   The most intelligent of the goblin races, the gnolls, rule the lesser
   races in
   their racefamily. However, those scarce gnolls who take up an
   adventuring
   career are shun upon by their own clan. They become outcasts. Traedyn,
   one of
   the first outcasts, condemned these actions of the clan. He took upon
   the task
   to help those who choose the life of an adventurer. He founded the
   Outcasts.
