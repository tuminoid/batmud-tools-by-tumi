                   [fonter.php?str=The+Tinmen+Collective]

                           The Tinmen Collective

   Command: tinmen_collective
   Creator: [22]Sirdar
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   What's a mortal to make of the tinmens, those strange creatures of
   absolute
   order who whir and click in our very midst? Theirs are not like other
   lives -
   even the infinitely subtle demons are more comprehensible than these
   thronging
   drones. To an outsider it appears the tinmen have no existence other
   than as a
   whole. Indeed, there is a saying: 'To look at one tinmen is to look at
   all of
   them.' It is only logical, as it is with all things tinmen, that they
   are
   native to the magical world of Oz. To understand the tinmen, a being
   must stop
   thinking like a person, like an individual. Only then can anyone hope
   to
   comprehend the patterns of tinmen life.
