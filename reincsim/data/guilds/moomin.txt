                             The Groke Defense

   Command: groke_defense
   Creator: [22]Malitrius
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   The Groke is the terror of everyone, the unmentionable horror. Big,
   grey and
   so cold that frost appears on the ground she soundlessly shuffles
   along.
   Occasionally she suddenly appears close by, but otherwise she is
   mostly heard
   howling from a distance. The Moomin family is sometimes scared of her,
   but she
   is also considered to give a little bit of zest to life. Moomin lives
   life
   fully, and views the world with a feeling of wonderment for such
   simple
   pleasures as collecting stones and shells. As gullible as he is
   enthusiastic,
   he is also naive and extremely good-natured. The Groke Defense is
   basically
   just a funny game for them, more of social character then anything
   else.
