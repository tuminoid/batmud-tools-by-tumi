                       The Order of the Shadow Sabres

   Command: sabres
   Creator: [22]Shardik
   Maximum level: 30
   Description:
   The Order of the Shadow Sabres was originally found on 9th day
   of the 9th month, gods' year 642. This was the date when one of
   the higher archwizards (also known as the Dark One), gave one
   of the lesser wizards an approval for setting up the Order. The
   Order had been requested by a mere mortal, Caitline his name.
   What is this guild about then, you may wonder? Well, one way to
   see it would be that it is about skills in melee battle. There are,
   however, guilds that are much stronger in this aspect... however
   none of those are available for this particular background. This
   guild is not just a weaker version of the 'real' tank guilds, there
   is an original flavor or two in it.
   This guild is civilized, and civilization mean here more than the
   sole background. Members of the Order of Shadow Sabres (which is a
   suitably flamboyant name) are dependent on things like fine clothing,
   good food and other things of same manner; perhaps a glass of refined
   Shadowkepian wine or high-class pipe tobacco. If you, dear reader, are
   not interested in 'things of flavor', and have a hard time imagining
   yourself as a gastronomer and a snappy dresser - perhaps this guild
   is not for you? That is a decision for you alone to make, of course.
   Style, grandiloquence and protection of the Realms are important
   matters for the members of the Order. Many are the terrors and
   nuisances that bother the dwellers of this world, from demons of many
   colors to petty orcs that invade the City of Bats occasionally. Also
   are many the possibilities to demonstrate your supremacy over others;
   perhaps by catching the hiding mage, being the first to catch a
   running fox... or uniting a broken statue depicting ancient evil?
   Of these things the Order of the Shadow Sabres consists of, and of
   some
   more. Wear an elegant hat (with a feather), wield shiny sabres and
   join us to bring some colour in to the Realms.
