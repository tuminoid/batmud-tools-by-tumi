                              The Monkey Squad

   Command: monkey_squad
   Creator: [22]Runeaxe
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   The monkey squad is a fierce team of four armed albino monkeys, also
   known as
   barsoomians. Barsoomians have been one of the most witted fighters in
   BatMUD
   ever since they arrived from their homeworld, a red planet they called
   Barsoomian Prime, a long long time ago. Here young barsoomians are
   taught the
   ways of their ancestors dating back to the days when they lived on
   Barsoomian
   Prime.
