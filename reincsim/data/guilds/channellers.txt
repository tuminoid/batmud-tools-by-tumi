                 [fonter.php?str=The+Guild+of+Channellers]

                          The Guild of Channellers

   Command: channellers
   Creator: [22]Shinarae
   Maximum level: 30
   Description:
   Channellers are those to whom the manipulation of magical forces is
   more
   instinctive than learned. They are masters of their domain, the
   directing of
   magical energies from one source to another. Not only can they use
   their
   powers in combat, but they can place magical powers into mundane
   items, and
   even drain magical energy from other places into themselves.
   At the dawning of this day, the leader was Glaurung.
