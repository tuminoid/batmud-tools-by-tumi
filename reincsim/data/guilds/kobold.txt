                           The Kobold Tunnel Rats

   Command: tunnelrat
   Creator: [22]Shinarae
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   Most kobolds are abused by the larger races, bullied into dangerous
   and risky
   jobs nobody wants to do. Orcs use them to test caves and mine tunnels
   for
   integrity, letting the lighter kobolds test the floors for hidden pits
   or
   deadfalls. Trolls employ them as scouts of sorts, hurling them into
   villages
   or castles and following the screams of the kobold when the
   inhabitants
   slaughter it. As such, over the generations, kobolds have learned a
   few
   tricks, letting them stay alive longer in such conditions and maybe
   picking up
   a stray bauble or two before their captors notice it is missing.
