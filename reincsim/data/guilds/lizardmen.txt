                      The Hall of the Slithering Horde

   Command: slithering_horde
   Creator: [22]Entropy
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   Lizardmen are known for their prowess in combat as well as their
   survivability
   in the wilderness. These skills are used to keep them alive in the
   harsh
   outside world. As soon as a lizardman hatches the young broodlings are
   sent
   through a vigorous training program which helps them stay alive long
   enough to
   grow larger and stronger. Not only do lizardmen learn combat skills
   here but
   they also learn skills that are essential for their survival.
