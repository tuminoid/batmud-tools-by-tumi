                              Guild of Alchemy

   Command: alchemists
   Creator: [22]Lanfear
   Maximum level: 30
   Description:
   Alchemists are born to create things. Being the inquisitive type they
   love to
   experiment. Often found wandering around searching for new forms of
   minerals
   and plant life, they strive to produce powerful potions and invent new
   wonderful items. They have the ability to manipulate minerals to such
   an
   extent, that often people refer to them as magic-hands. Alchemists
   tend to be
   pacifist, and will prefer to defend themselves using powers learnt
   through
   their experiments. Despite being somewhat secretive, the alchemist
   guild
   always welcomes new members.
