                                  Rangers

   Command: ranger
   Creator: [22]Duke
   Maximum level: 35
   Description:
   The ranger is a hunter and a woodsman who lives not by only his sword
   but also his wits. Robin Hood, Orion, Jack the giant killer, and the
   huntress of Dianna are examples of rangers from history and legend.
   The abilities of the ranger make him particulary good at tracking,
   woodcraft, and spying.
