                    The Galfang's School of Mercenaries

   Command: merc_school
   Creator: [22]Hablo
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   The ogres are notorious for their abilities in combat. This is no
   wonder since
   every young ogre goes through the harsh training of the famous
   Galfang's
   School of Mercenaries. Here young ogres learn the basic fighting
   skills from
   the master himself. Many graduates of the school have served in
   various armies
   and warbands of many other races as hired guns. The school also gives
   good
   background for young adventurous ogres.
