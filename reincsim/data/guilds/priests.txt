                                Evil Priests

   Command: priests
   Creator: [22]coren
   Maximum level: 35
   Description:
   Evil Priests originally started as a small cult with few devoted
   followers,
   but over the years its strength, as well as the number of followers
   increased.
   Their hatred grew with every new member. They chose to follow several
   evil
   gods instead of being singularly devoted to any one specificly. But
   they are
   closest to Burglefloogah and Draen-Dalar in temperment. Draen-Dalar
   accepts
   any mortal who wishes to follow him, but his pledges must make a life
   time
   commitment to serve only evil. For this reason initiates to the guild
   start
   out serving only Draen-Dalar. Only after they obtain his blessings by
   obtaining power and serving evil in its truest form can they expand
   their
   horizons and commit themselves to other gods for additional power.
   Evil is a
   general thing and everyone has a bit within them. The stronger the
   evil the
   better and the more powerful the priest. The High Priest is the gods'
   main
   link to the world therefore more powerful and has greater
   responsibility
   within the guild itself.
   Both gods smile upon those who use their evil gifts to bring evil into
   the
   world, although it has been rumored that the harming of a newbie can
   have dire
   consequences. For a newbie's path is uncertain that soon in life, so
   little,
   if any, should be done to harm or hinder them. One should also strive
   to be
   evil incarnate and avoid those that are pure of heart. For a time of
   reckoning
   will come. And then the follower will truly know how they appear in
   their gods
   eyes...
