                              The Bards' guild

   Command: bard
   Creators: [22]Amarth, [23]Shardik, [24]Walin
   Maximum level: 30
   Description:
   There isn't a real adventuring-party of the true nature without a
   ravishing member of the Bards' guild in it. As bards are considered
   generally musical artists who preserve and describe tales and legends
   through their songs, are the Shadowkepian bards also developed from
   this starting point.
   Generally acknowledged as one of the less power-hungered guilds,
   getting familiar with a true bard is most likely to be an unique
   experience. Bards are bound into exploring, facing overpowerful
   enemies, bitterly learning the lore and universally having a blast
   of it all. One of the elder sayings go 'there is no merrier than
   the heart of a bard when death is imminent.'
   Bards have some fighting skills and a few outrageous songspells.
   Advancing in the guild often requires some story-writing skills and
   completion of specific guild quests. As weapons, bards fashion short
   and long blades; seldomly also bows.
   Important: Remember to read the guide in the joining room for more
   exact information about songcasting and bards in general.

     Background must be civilized
     The most notable item for every bard is the newly fashioned ANKH!
   that
     has its roots in the Shadowkepian way of life; while being a symbol
   for
     healing and goodness it has now gained another meaning that aspires
   even
     higher - it is the epithet of divine sound.
     Bards are granted mainly dexterity, but also wisdom during their
   career.
     Bards regain their songcasting points rapidly.
