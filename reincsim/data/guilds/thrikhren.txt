                            The Mantis Warriors

   Command: mantis_warrior
   Creator: [22]Sirdar
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   The history of the thrikhren race, how they came to be of so noble of
   their
   origins, is not a simple tale. It includes tradegy called as the
   phaerimm, the
   monsters of the desert, who were seemingly unbeatable, using puppets
   to wage
   war with their extensive mental controlling ablities. Once upon a
   time, a hero
   among the thrikhren, Xorlab Kxoh, found the secret to block this
   control and
   therefore, control one's own mind of all abominations. The mantis
   warriors are
   the cast Xorlab still teaches this, even from afterworld. So great
   hero he was
   that all the thrikhren revere and worship him, and wander usually once
   in
   their life here, learning the secrets of the mind from the great
   teacher still
   living in this tower.
