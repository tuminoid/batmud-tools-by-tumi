                          The Riders of the Storm

   Command: storm_riders
   Creator: [22]Shardik
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   The private guild of the centaurs is a simple thing; a loose
   organization that
   doesn't bind anyone too much. Some skills are taught, of course. Young
   centaurs may find these useful, if they pay attention to the lessons
   instead
   of daydreaming about unicorn chicks.
