   The trolls have love and hate relationship towards water. Water is
   harmful for
   their innards, but water teems with the delicious fishes and swampy
   riverbanks

   bridges
   either. Bridges are the good source of treasure and occasional snack

   basic tricks
   of guarding bridges and dealing with customers under the guidance of
   Frough,
