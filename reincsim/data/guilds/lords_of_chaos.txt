                               Lords of Chaos

   Command: lord_chaos
   Creator: [22]ikar
   Maximum level: 30
   Description:
   Dedicated to the study of blades to the exclusion of all else, the
   Lords of
   Chaos become a formidable foe. Members of this order grow in power as
   they
   learn to communicate and rely on their chosen blade, which has a
   decided
   thirst for blood.
