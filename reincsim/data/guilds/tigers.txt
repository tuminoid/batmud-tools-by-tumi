Name: The Brotherhood of the Black Tiger
Command: tiger
Creator: Dragoness
Your level: 30
Maximum level: 30

Description:
The Brotherhood of Black Tiger is an organization of assassins who worship
Great Curath, the Designer of Deception. Curath is a generous deity and
therefore doesn't require much worship. An occasional murder in His name is
usually enough to satisfy His modest needs of worship. The Brothers of Black
Tiger usually only kill people they have been hired to kill but occasionally
they kill just to keep their skills honed.
Tiger trainers are among the most demanding in physical fields and this
combined with their magical training turns (the surviving) Tigers into one of
the most efficient assassins in the world.
