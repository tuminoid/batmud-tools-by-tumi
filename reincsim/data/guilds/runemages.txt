                          The Faculte of Runemagi

   Command: runemages
   Creators: [22]Nalle, [23]Shardik
   Maximum level: 30
   Description:
   The Faculte of the Runemagi is an order of scholars dedicated to
   the research of ancient runes and the magic therein. The lore weaved
   by the runemages originates from world magic, encapsulated into
   runestones. The stones can be sculpted by the mage himself and must
   then be placed into his personal cryptroom located in a labyrinthine
   network of underground tunnels, below the campus of the faculte.
   The mindset of the guild is atheistic, the view on magic is
   scientific;
   the worship of gods and all things religious are frowned upon and
   ridiculed. New spells can only be mastered through extensive research
   and as a result, new initiates will not successfully cast spells for
   quite a while after joining the guild.
   As any respectable guild, the runemagi only accept new initiates
   of a civilized background.
