                            The Cult of Reavers

   Command: reaver
   Creators: [22]Shinarae, [23]Firefox
   Maximum level: 30
   Description:
   The reavers are a dangerous, possibly insane religion that thrives on
   the
   death, destruction, pain, and suffering of others weaker than
   themselves,
   while at the same time insuring their own survival. They roam the
   land,
   smashing art, murdering families, and burning down villages. Nothing
   is sacred
   to a reaver except himself and his sacrifices to his dark lord.
