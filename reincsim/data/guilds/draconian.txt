   Description:
   You begin to read the ancient book about dragon bonding.
   The ritual is written in an ancient language but you're
   experienced enough to understand it:

   Black of eye, Black of wing
   Lord of Forethought, and Afterthought!
   This is the White dawn I conjure, O People
   This is The East I conjure
   This is Her Living Breath I Conjure
   And this is the making of the world
   I call The Wolf
   Red eyed and White fang
   Lord of desire and passion!
   This is the Red Noon of Day I conjure, O people!
   This is the South I conjure
   This is Her Living Blood I conjure
   and this is the Making of the World
   I call the Silkie
   Seal of the Sea, Woman of the Land
   Lady of Mystery and Transformation
   This is the Blue Twilight I conjure, O People!
   This is The West I conjure
   This is Her Living Blood, I Conjure
   And this is The Making of the World
   I call The Dragon

   Woman to Man
   When the two are made one
   The Earth is made whole
   Ancient Ones, Old ones
   Rules of The Elemental Realms
   You who are With us
   I call The Dragon
   Old and Grim, Mountain Bones
   Lord of Strength and Power!
   Come for the Bond That is yet Unbroken
   Come for the Sake of Kinship
   A draconian is a very special creature that are created in a ritual
   where he
   bonds with a dragon. A rite that grants the succesful human, cause
   it's only
   possible for humans, almost immortal powers. The alliance takes months
   to
   complete, but the human gradually blends together with the dragon and
   his
   physical appereance gradually becomes more and more dragonlike. Very
   few real
   draconians are known to exist on BatMUD. A common missunderstanding is
   that
   baaz, bozak, sivak, aurak and kapaks are draconians. A fully developed
   draconian looks more like a dragon then a human. They have heavy
   bodies,
   reptilian snouts and a thick lizard tails. They even starts walking on
   four
   legs instead of two, though he still can use his hands as freely as
   before.
   The kind of draconian you become heavily depends on what dragon you
   bond to
   and the bond has to be nurished the whole time if the draconian
   doesn't want
   to loose his powers. They are not evil by default; there are neutral
   and even
   good ones. But the subtle dragon bond has an evil warping influence,
   which
   slowly makes them psychotic and bitter. A draconian usually developes
   crude
   behavior and perverse desires.
