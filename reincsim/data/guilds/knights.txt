                           The Legion of Knights

   Command: knight
   Creators: [22]Shinarae, [23]Elwood
   Maximum level: 15
   Description:
   Knights are the honourable champions of the kingdom or region in which
   they
   serve. It is their sworn duty to protect the land and its people. Most
   knights
   are worthy fighters, capable of using strong armour and mighty
   weapons, and
   can fight equally well on horseback or on foot. While different
   knights may
   act in different ways -- some seek power and glory, others the greater
   good --
   they have a Code of behavior that they follow. They strive to be the
   best
   through the routes of Education, Conduct, Valor, and Skill.
