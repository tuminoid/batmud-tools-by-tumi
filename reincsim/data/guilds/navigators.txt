          [fonter.php?str=The+Association+of+Mystical+Navigators]

                   The Association of Mystical Navigators

   Command: navigator
   Creator: [22]Alaron
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   Over the centuries, the arts of mystical navigation gradually became
   dispersed among the various regions and guilds of the world. However,
   in this process, many spells were lost. No one guild could remembered
   them
   all.
   Then suddenly an amazing discovery was made: the original location of
   training for the ancient Mystical Navigators! Due to the great powers
   contained therein, only the most experienced of people are able to
   join and learn the secrets of mystical navigation. To access these
   abilities, one must know the world well.
