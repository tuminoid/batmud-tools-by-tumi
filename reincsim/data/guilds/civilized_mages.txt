                [fonter.php?str=The+Fellowship+of+Wizardry]

                         The Fellowship of Wizardry

   Command: civmage
   Creators: [22]Shardik, [23](Duke, [24]Alaron)
   Maximum level: 25
   Description:
   Over the ages, many people wished to study the art of wielding the
   forces
   around us. However, some were not willing to make the total commitment
   to the use of magic that the Brotherhood of Wizardry requires. Thus,
   the
   Fellowship of Wizardry was formed for these more casual students of
   the art of magic.
