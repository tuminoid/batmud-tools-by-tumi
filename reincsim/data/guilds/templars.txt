                          The Templars of Faerwon

   Command: templar
   Creators: [22]Grimsh, [23]Dragoness
   Maximum level: 30
   Description:
   Templars of Faerwon are an organization of knights devoted to Good.
   They
   wander around the world in teams of two and slay evil where it spawns.
   Their
   order has a tradition, that no templar should ever fight alone. The
   templars
   guide each other in the path of Goodness and guard their brother in
   arms that
   he should not get lost. Often the younger templar acts as the squire
   of the
   older templar.Faerwon frowns upon selfish deeds.
