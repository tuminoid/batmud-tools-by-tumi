   Command: seasingers
   Creator: [22]Malitrius
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   Merfolk communicate through a variety of different songs when they are
   beneath
   the surface. Not just among themself but also with dolphins, whales
   and other
   seafolk races. They got many different songs for formal announcements,
   religious occasions or just normal etiquette. And they get teached in
   their
   guild, seasingers. Merfolk are a very religious group. They build
   beautiful
   and elaborated temples of worshop. They have several different
   deitiest of the
   sea that they worship. The seven sea chorus also teaches the merfolk
   about how
   to survive on land and that is vital for all the adventuring merfolks
   upon
   batmud.
