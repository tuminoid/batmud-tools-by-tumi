                              The Psionicists

   Command: psionicist
   Creators: [22]Grimsh, [23]Blitzer, [24]Drakken
   Maximum level: 35
   Description:
   Psionicists are the masters of the mind. They also master certain
   common
   magics, but should not be associated with real magic-users; mages
   think of
   them as revolting abusers of the weave of magic (the psionicists are
   commonly
   feared for their unknown combinations of magic and powers of the
   mind).
