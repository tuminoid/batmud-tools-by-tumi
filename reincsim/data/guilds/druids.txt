                             The Humble Druids

   Command: druids
   Creator: [22]Lanfear
   Maximum level: 30
   Description:
   Druids are seekers of justice, and nature's defenders. They protect

   components to fight injustices make them formidable opponents in both
   physical and mental disciplines.
