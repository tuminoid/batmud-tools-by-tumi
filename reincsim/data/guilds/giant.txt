                        The Tribal Grounds of Giants

   Command: tribal_ground
   Creator: [22]Hablo
   Maximum level: 5
   Description:
   The Tribal Grounds of Giants act as training field of the giant youth.
   Giants
   from every clan are obliged to visit the ancient Tribal Grounds before
   their
   coming of age. Giants of every sect have kept this tradition of
   sending their
   youth to this field, thus clashes between young and tempered are not
   unreard
   of here. This is also partly the reason why the Tribal Grounds have
   kept its
   importance in the adulthood rite of giants.
