                                   Squire

   Command: squire
   Creators: [22]Elwood, [23]Shinarae
   Maximum level: 15
   Description:
   Classically, squires are young warriors serving a knight or similar
   master in
   exchange for training. While under the expert instructions of a
   seasoned
   fighter, they learn skills related to combat, adventuring, exploring,
   and any
   other suitable skills the master knows. Only by graduating from ones
   apprenticeship as a squire can you proceed into more challenging
   guilds that
   require combat expertise both on foot and on horseback. However, some
   may find
   the general purpose knowledge offered to squires reward enough in
   itself.
