|   or evil beings, total worth of three million experience        |

| Description                                                      |
|   It has come to guild elders' attention that forces of evil     |
|   are once again plotting against the guild in hopes of          |
|   destroying it. The elders are convinced that creature of       |
|   darkness has infiltrated inside the convent walls. Sister      |
|   Valentina and Sister Alysia have both secretly observed the    |
|   current members of our sisterhood and people living inside     |
|   the convent walls, without success. The evil has masked its    |
|   true essence too well to be found by normal means. We have     |
|   also learned that what ever the plot is, it is to be           |
|   executed anytime now. As the test of your abilities you are    |
|   temporarily given the status of Inquisitor and you may use     |
|   the Eye of Zion and hopefully eliminate the evil threat. We    |
|   accidentally got information about one low level evil          |
|   entity who is one link in this chain of evilness. You must     |
|   find this wicked creature and use the Eye of Zion to it and    |
|   then attack. Most beings are powerful enough to resist the     |
|   force of the Eye, but when they are slain there is a short     |
|   moment when soul loosens from the body and it can be read,     |
|   before the chaotic forces possess it. These means should       |
|   reveal the information needed to track down the next link      |
|   in the chain, all the way to the top. The evil master mind     |
|   behind this plot must know the false identity of the           |
|   creature that is hiding amongst us in our own convent. You     |
|   have about six hours to find out the code name of the evil     |
|   creature that is living amongst us and slay it. If you fail    |
|   to find it in time, it will most likely hear about your        |
|   search and hide from us. Then your only goal is to destroy     |
|   the whole chain of evil beings that are opposing a threat      |
|   to us. Remember that consequences of failure could lead to     |

| Description                                                      |
|   A brave nun was today killed in the battlefield while          |
|   trying to slay an evil overlord. Her soul was captured by      |
|   this fiend and her body was filled with evil spirits and       |
|   sent to haunt mortal men as an undead being. We must           |
|   reclaim the body of the nun and her spirit so we can           |
|   resurrect her. It is important that you find her undead        |
|   body quickly before some incompetent fool slays it and         |
|   spoils the body. Same goes for this evil overlord who still    |
|   holds the soul of that nun, undoubtedly torturing it. Pick     |
|   up the soul crystal from task room so that the released        |
|   soul of the nun gets stored in the crystal when the evil       |
|   overlord is slain. Track down and slay the undead body         |
|   which is now filled with evil spirits and bring both           |
|   crystal, where her spirit is stored and the body released      |
|   from evil spirit to Sister Esmeralda and give them to her.     |
|   She will then perform the resurrection. The elders will        |
|   inform you if either the body or the soul is lost and you      |
|   have failed. You have approximately four (4) hours before      |
|   the soul dies. You must accomplish this task within a boot.    |

| Help                                                             |
|   Once started the task you will be given the name and           |
|   location of the evil overlord who now holds the soul of        |
|   innocent nun and last location of the undead body of that      |
|   innocent nun which is now filled with demonic spirits. Take    |
|   soul crystal from task room, the soul will be stored there     |
|   once you have slew the overlord. Search and slay the evil      |
|   body controlled by evil spirits and take the body with you.    |
|   When you have both body and the soul give them to Sister       |
|   Esmeralda and she will take it from there.                     |

|   The most powerful and sacred relic in all Bat realm is the     |
|   cross of Angelique. The cross was stolen from the old          |
|   convent when daemons attacked it. However the relic was too    |
|   powerful to be destroyed so the minions of evil cut it in      |
|   eight pieces and scattered them around the world. You must     |
|   seek all cross pieces and bring them to Sister Bernadette.     |
|   The Synod has knowledge on the location of one of the          |
|   pieces. You must go and find it and use that piece to track    |
|   the others. It is well known that the cross parts glow when    |
|   touched if any of the other parts of the cross are in the      |
|   same region. The pieces have a strong magical shield around    |
|   them so that not anyone can pick them up. If you choose to     |
|   take the task, the synod will cast a spell over you so that    |
|   the pieces will trust you and let you pick them up. When       |
|   started the task, you have precisely twentyfour hours to       |
|   find all the pieces and return them to Sister Bernadette.      |

| Help                                                             |
|   Use the first cross piece to find the others. The piece        |
|   will glow when touched if there are other cross parts in       |
|   that region. When found all of them (eight), give them to      |
|   Sister Bernadette. You may give them as you find them, just    |
|   remember to keep one to yourself in order find the others.     |
