As were closing ONE MILLION pageloads on ReincSim, I thought I'd put up a little trivia about the sim.

The one with most correct answers will receive a nice title for the boards (unless they already have one).

You may reply to this thread as no-one else does not know the correct answers than me. Fun for all to see what others guess :)

1) How many saved reincarnation simulations there is as of 11th Nov 2004 10:44?
