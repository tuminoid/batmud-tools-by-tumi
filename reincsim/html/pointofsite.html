The reinc simulator is written to help you plan your future reincs (or live a
what-if life). You can design
a complete reinc, and re-calculate costs for different races in couple clicks!
Changing the guild is easy too, and if you have already designed your guild (and
submitted it), even the overlapping skills and spells will follow you! Clearing
and creating another new reinc is single click-away.
The designed reincs may be saved to the server so you can show them off to your
friends or continue planning laters, using <span style="font-weight: bold;">Quicklink</span>.

<p>Sep'06: Now registered and logged on users will gain several different benefits, like
storing the reincs in the memory of the sim, loading quest presets etc!</p>
